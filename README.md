# Vizapp

Built with Django (web version at `vizweb`) and Flutter (mobile version at `vizmobile`).

## Task
Build a hybrid app (mobile and web) to allow the user to upload an image and process the image using Visual Recognition (https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/services/visual-recognition) and display the classes returned. You are free to use any language or framework or hosting site you prefer.
